# React-Food-Order-App
## App coded along with udemy course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller, with slight adjustments in design 

The app displays specific food with a title, short description, price, and option to choose a certain amount of meal you want and add it to the cart. Cart component displays meals we added in cart with a price tag, allowing us to change the amount of portion or remove the meal from cart, calculating the total price of meals added in cart.
